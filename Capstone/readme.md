**Capstone Project**

The Capstone Project is a way to showcase all the learnings from the Containers track in a working example. You are expected to pick one of the use cases below. For an actual implementation, research something that might be usable in your current organization or customer. Think about how it might be used to build modernization using containers within your organization or in the customer organization.

**Scenarios**



**Evaluation Criteria**

Your Capstone project will be evaluated by a Specialist SA Panel and the Blackbelt Program team using the criteria in this rubric. The rubric is NOT an exhaustive list of Do's and Don'ts. It is meant to serve as Pillars (Cluster Management, Workloads, GitOps/Automation, Add-ons, and Security) 

Each Pillar is either evaluated as Below The Bar, Meets the Bar or Raises the Bar.

Below the Bar = Not Meeting Best Practices for this Category
Meets the Bar = Bare Minimum Best Practices for this Category
Raise the Bar = Applying All Best Practices and Recommendations for this Category

Points are awarded based on how each pillar was addressed in your Capstone Project. There are guidelines available for each Pillar. These are NOT an exhaustive list of everything you should be or should not be doing. They are merely examples to help guide you in the right direction. 

Use your best judgement and logic to make sure you are aiming for "Raising The Bar" for every pillar. As always, any questions? Reach out to the Black Belt team.

See the Capstone rubric (https://github.com/kiranrandhi/bb-2021-analytics/blob/main/Capstone/BB%202021%20Data%20%26%20Analytics%20CapStone%20Rubric.png) for details.

**Due Date**

Your Capstone Project time limit is 4 weeks from the end of the Containers Track. So roughly speaking June 24th, 2022.

**Submission Details**

We will discuss the submission process on May 25th '2022 during a live session.

**So What Makes a Great Capstone Project?**

1. Think Well-Architected
2. Think About The Capstone Rubric Pillars
3. Try to Use a Real Need (For a PoC, Pilot etc)
4. Think Long Term, How To Take This to Build or Advance Your Containers Practice
